Hash Tables (Common Interview Question)
Java (Hash Maps)
Python (Dictionary)

basket.grapes = 10000

Key- 'grapes'

Hash function: that generates a fixed value or a certain length

idempotent: A function given an input always gives the same output

Hash functions: 
insert 0(1)
lookup 0(1)
delete 0(1)
search 0(1)

Hash Collisions: 
Can happen when too much data is added to a hashtable 
and data gets stored in the same index. This slows down functions.
0(n)

There are different methods to resolve collisions 

Java:
 Hash Map:
 Allows you to save any data type as the key

JavaScript:
 Objects can only save the key as a string.

Python:
 Sets: Only stores the key
